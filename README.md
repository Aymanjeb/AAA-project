## Heart Attack Risk Prediction

Welcome to the Heart Attack Risk Prediction project repository! The primary goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting the risk of a heart attack for an individual based on their medical and personal information.
Repository Contents:

   -  Data Exploration:
        This file comprehensively explores the 25 features present in our dataset. It includes visualizations to provide a broad understanding of the classification problem.

   -  Data Preprocessing and Modeling:
        Beginning with a data preparation phase, this file includes experimentation with various models and the fine-tuning of the best-performing one.

   -  Data Augmentation:
        To address data imbalance, this file focuses on resolving the issue through the implementation of an oversampling technique.

### Dataset:

The dataset required for the project is available in the dedicated folder within this repository.
